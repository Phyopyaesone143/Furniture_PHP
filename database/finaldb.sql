Just like my love for soccer has changed even though I still love it but it is different, and i do not really play out there anymore. Then I started to grow up and the feeling kind of changed, it was not that amazing anymore, but still enjoyed going out there just to play soccer.

(12, 'New living room', 'blog-6.jpg', 'The living room is a room that is specifically designed for unwinding and socialization. Let us suppose the living room in your house is messy, cozy, smells of sweat, and has an unattractive look. It is the time where you think that your living room is not designed properly with a good concept. Then, what is a good concept for a living room? A good concept can be anything that can describe the personality of the homeowner, convey a specific message, or follow a particular style. From research and experience, there are several living room concepts which can be used to guide people in designing their living room. When it is all about the living room, it must be a formal and a casual living room. A formal living room is usually designed for a meeting impression with your boss, father or mother-in-law, etc. This type of living room usually has high-standard furniture and decorations. A casual living room is contradicted to the formal living room; it is designed to get a relaxed and comfortable impression with your friends and family, and this one is more flexible to do with any kind of furniture and decoration. From there, it comes a modern and traditional living room. A modern living room is reflecting a simple and clean impression with a minimum amount of furniture. It is suitable for urban people who have a busy life. A modern living room also gives an advanced impression for the homeowner. A traditional living room is more friendly with more furniture and usually has a classic style decoration. This type of living room is more attractive for older people and those who like vintage. And the last is an indoor and an outdoor living room. It is a rare concept, but you can simply differentiate it from the placement.', '2025-04-04', 'admin'),
